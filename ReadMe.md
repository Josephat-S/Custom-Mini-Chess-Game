## üß© Mini-Chess Game

The Mini-Chess Game project is a simplified, educational chess system designed to demonstrate the integration of game logic, database design, and user interaction. The project is developed by a student team as part of a software development course, focusing on collaboration, planning, and database management.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Progress

Requirements and system scope defined

db design and ER diagram completed

GitHub repository prepared for documentation and future implementation

## Game Rules:

## Board Setup
- The game is played on a 5x5 grid.
- Each player controls two types of pieces:
  - **Leader (L)**
  - **Soldier (S)**
- Initial positions:
  - **Player1:** Leader at (4,2), Soldiers at (3,1) and (3,3)
  - **Player2:** Leader at (0,2), Soldiers at (1,1) and (1,3)

## Piece Movement

### Leader (L)
- Moves one square in any direction (orthogonal or diagonal).
- Symbol:¬†`L`
- Example: From (4,2), valid moves are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) [assuming within board bounds].

### Soldier (S)
- Moves forward one square (no diagonal or sideways movement).
- Symbol:¬†`S`
- Direction:
  - **Player1 Soldiers:** Move upward (from higher row to lower row).
  - **Player2 Soldiers:** Move downward (from lower row to higher row).
- Example: A Player1 Soldier at (3,1) can only move to (2,1).

## Move Rules
- Players alternate turns.
- On your turn, enter move as: `fromRow fromCol toRow toCol` (e.g., `3 1 2 1`).
- You may only move your own pieces.
- A move is only valid if:
  - The destination square is within move rules for that piece.
  - The destination square is empty or contains an opponent‚Äôs piece (which will be captured).
  - You cannot move onto a square occupied by your own piece.

## Captures
- If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent‚Äôs piece, the opponent‚Äôs piece is captured and removed from the board.
- Captures are announced in the console.

## Win Condition
- The game ends immediately when a player's **Leader** is captured.
- The player who captures the opponent‚Äôs Leader wins.
- If both Leaders remain, the game continues.

## User Interface
- The board is displayed as a grid with `[L]` for Leader, `[S]` for Soldier, and `[ ]` for empty.
- Players enter moves via console input.

## Example Game
Initial Board:
```
[ ] [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [S] [ ] [S] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [S] [ ] [S] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
```
(Player1 at bottom, Player2 at top)

## Other Notes
- No special moves (castling, pawn promotion, en passant, etc.).
- No check/checkmate; only Leader capture matters.
- No draw conditions implemented (e.g., stalemate, repetition).
